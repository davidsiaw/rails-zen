# You can configure sidekiq's concurrency like this:
#:concurrency: 5
#staging:
#  :concurrency: 10
#production:
#  :concurrency: 20
#:queues:
#  - critical
#  - default
#  - low

# You can have sidekiq run a job every once in a while like this:
# https://github.com/moove-it/sidekiq-scheduler
#:schedule:
#  CancelAbandonedOrders:
#    cron: '0 */5 * * * *'   # Runs when second = 0, every 5 minutes
#
#  queue_documents_for_indexing:
#    cron: '0 0 * * * *'   # Runs every hour
#
#    # By default the job name will be taken as worker class name.
#    # If you want to have a different job name and class name, provide the 'class' option
#    class: QueueDocuments
#
#    queue: slow
#    args: ['*.pdf']
#    description: "This job queues pdf content for indexing in solr"
#
#    # Enable the `metadata` argument which will pass a Hash containing the schedule metadata
#    # as the last argument of the `perform` method. `false` by default.
#    include_metadata: true
#
#    # Enable / disable a job. All jobs are enabled by default.
#    enabled: true
